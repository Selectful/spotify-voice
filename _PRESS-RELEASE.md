There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Spotify Voice

## Sub-Heading ##
  The market for this product would be for anyone who has their hands full and would like a  way to play music other than typing through voice commands.

## Summary ##
  Spotify Voice will help any music lovers listen to music without lifting a finger. It will use voice activation and the keyword "Play" followed by a song name to play that song. 

## Problem ##
  The problem many of us have is that if we are not at the computer, perhaps a bathroom or shower break or we are in bed and want to play some relaxing music, we would not want to get up from the comfort of our bed just to click a button. Likewise, if you are in a different room such as feeding your baby or you're busy eating greasy food you wouldn't want to grease your precious macbook or pc.

## Solution ##
  Instead, you can say something like: "Play Flapper Girl" or "Play Flapper Girl by the Lumineers" or "Play (Insert Album here)" and it will play that song for you with that artist or album. 

## Quote from You ##
"Spotify Voice is the new Facebook."

## How to Get Started ##
"Just launch the app from the web browser, and it will listen for anything after the keyword 'Play'".

## Customer Quote ##
  "Wow, my life has changed since using Spotify Voice, I sing in the shower more, the sky is more blue, and it has helped me in tremendous ways through my struggles in life."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  "If you are still here then I must be really good at writing! Go to the link to get started!"
